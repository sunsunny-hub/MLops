# This repo is created for MLOps POC

In this POC i have created the TensorFlow model of image classification using Tensorflow dataset. I also i have done deployment of tensorflow model into GKE using cloudbuild for CI/CD integration. 

Cloud Build is a managed service on Google Cloud Platform that allows you to continuously build, test and deploy containers on various google services like GKE, Cloud Run, App Engine and others. Cloud Build can import source code from a variety of repositories or cloud storage spaces, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.

Also trigger has been created using GitHub google cloud build trigger extension, which triggers cloudbuild pipeline whenever there is commit to main branch.

Thanks!!!!!!!!
